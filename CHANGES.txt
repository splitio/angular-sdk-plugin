0.4.0 (Oct 5, 2022)
 - Added a new impressions mode for the SDK called NONE, to be used in factory when there is no desire to capture impressions on an SDK factory to feed Split's analytics engine. Running NONE mode, the SDK will only capture unique keys evaluated for a particular feature flag instead of full blown impressions.
 - Updated default value of `scheduler.featuresRefreshRate` config parameter from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-browserjs package to version 0.9.0, which includes:
    - Updated storage implementations to improve the performance of split evaluations (i.e., `getTreatment(s)` method calls) when using the default storage in memory.
    - Updated browser listener to push remaining impressions and events on 'visibilitychange' and 'pagehide' DOM events, instead of 'unload', which is not reliable in modern mobile and desktop Web browsers.
    - Among other improvements and vulnerability fixes.

0.3.0 (Jun 30, 2022)
 - Added a new config option to control the tasks that listen or poll for updates on feature flags and segments, via the new config sync.enabled .

Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
 - Updated telemetry logic to track the anonymous config for user consent flag set to declined or unknown.
 - Updated submitters logic, to avoid duplicating the post of impressions to Split cloud when the SDK is destroyed while its periodic post of impressions is running.
