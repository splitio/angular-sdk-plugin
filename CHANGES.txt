2.0.0 (Dec 18, 2023)
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-browserjs package to version 0.13.0
 - Updated the minimum Angular version to match Angular's support up to date. Breaking change version is regarding the Angular minimum version update, there are no breaking changes to Split's plugin API or functionality itself.
 - Added support for Flag Sets on the SDK, which enables grouping feature flags and interacting with the group rather than individually (more details in our documentation):
 - Added new variations of the get treatment methods to support evaluating flags in given flag set/s.
    - getTreatmentsByFlagSet and getTreatmentsByFlagSets
    - getTreatmentsWithConfigByFlagSets and getTreatmentsWithConfigByFlagSets
 - Added a new optional Split Filter configuration option. This allows the SDK and Split services to only synchronize the flags in the specified flag sets, avoiding unused or unwanted flags from being synced on the SDK instance, bringing all the benefits from a reduced payload.
 - Added `sets` property to the `SplitView` object returned by the `split` and `splits` methods of the SDK manager to expose flag sets on flag views.
 - Added `defaultTreatment` property to the `SplitView` object returned by the `split` and `splits` methods of the SDK manager (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-commons/issues/225).

1.0.2 (May 16, 2023)
 - Updated terminology on the SDKs codebase to be more aligned with current standard without causing a breaking change. The core change is the term split for feature flag on things like logs and JSDocs tags.

1.0.1 (Jan 12, 2023)
 - Explicitly added ngsw-bypass parameter into streaming url to avoid issues with default Angular service workers configurations
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-browserjs package to version 0.9.2, which includes:
    - Updated some transitive dependencies for vulnerability fixes.
    - Bugfixing - Upgrade @splitsoftware/splitio-commons package to version 1.7.3 which includes a memory leak fix for localhost mode (Related to issue https://github.com/splitio/javascript-commons/issues/181) among other improvements.

1.0.0 (Dec 15, 2022)
 - Updated the minimum Angular version to match Angular's support up to date. Breaking change version is regarding the Angular minimum version update, there are no breaking changes to Split's plugin API or functionality itself.

0.4.0 (Oct 5, 2022)
 - Added a new impressions mode for the SDK called NONE, to be used in factory when there is no desire to capture impressions on an SDK factory to feed Split's analytics engine. Running NONE mode, the SDK will only capture unique keys evaluated for a particular feature flag instead of full blown impressions.
 - Updated default value of `scheduler.featuresRefreshRate` config parameter from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
 - Updated @splitsoftware/splitio-browserjs package to version 0.9.0, which includes:
    - Updated storage implementations to improve the performance of split evaluations (i.e., `getTreatment(s)` method calls) when using the default storage in memory.
    - Updated browser listener to push remaining impressions and events on 'visibilitychange' and 'pagehide' DOM events, instead of 'unload', which is not reliable in modern mobile and desktop Web browsers.
    - Among other improvements and vulnerability fixes.

0.3.0 (Jun 30, 2022)
 - Added a new config option to control the tasks that listen or poll for updates on feature flags and segments, via the new config sync.enabled . Running online Split will always pull the most recent updates upon initialization, this only affects updates fetching on a running instance. Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
 - Updated telemetry logic to track the anonymous config for user consent flag set to declined or unknown.
 - Updated submitters logic, to avoid duplicating the post of impressions to Split cloud when the SDK is destroyed while its periodic post of impressions is running.

0.2.0 (Jun 3, 2022)
 - Updated some names and initial public release.

0.1.0 (May 27, 2022)
 - Initial NPM release.
