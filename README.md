## Compatibility

This SDK is compatible with Angular 18.0.0 and above.

## Getting started

Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:
```javascript
// Import the Service
import { SplitService } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-angular';

export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(
    // inject SplitService dependency
    private splitio: SplitService
  ) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {

    // Subscribe to init to make sure the SDK is properly loaded before asking for a treatment
    this.splitio.init({
      core: {
        authorizationKey: 'YOUR_SDK_KEY',
        key: 'CUSTOMER_ID'
      }
    }).subscribe(() => {
      var treatment = this.splitio.getTreatment('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME');
      if (treatment == 'on') {
        // insert code here for on treatment
      } else if (treatment == 'off') {
        // insert code here for off treatment
      } else {
        // insert your control treatment code here
      }
    });
  }
}
```
