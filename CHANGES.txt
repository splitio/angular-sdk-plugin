0.3.0 (Jun 30, 2022)
 - Added a new config option to control the tasks that listen or poll for updates on feature flags and segments, via the new config sync.enabled . Running online Split will always pull the most recent updates upon initialization, this only affects updates fetching on a running instance. Useful when a consistent session experience is a must or to save resources when updates are not being used.
 - Updated telemetry logic to track the anonymous config for user consent flag set to declined or unknown.
 - Updated submitters logic, to avoid duplicating the post of impressions to Split cloud when the SDK is destroyed while its periodic post of impressions is running.

0.2.0 (Jun 3, 2022)

0.1.0 (May 27, 2022)
